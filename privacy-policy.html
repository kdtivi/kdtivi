  <h1>Privacy Policy for KDTIVI</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: November 20, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how KDTIVI (the "App") collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use our application on Apple TV (tvOS).</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
  <p>The core function of KDTIVI is to serve as a <strong>media playback client</strong>. The App is designed solely to display and play user-provided content streams.</p>

  <p><strong>KDTIVI DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY MEDIA CONTENT, CHANNELS, OR PLAYLISTS.</strong></p>

  <p>All content is supplied, managed, and controlled exclusively by the user. As a result of this design philosophy, we prioritize your privacy and collect an extremely limited amount of information.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>The developer of KDTIVI, referred to as "we," "us," or "our," <strong>does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)</strong> from users of the App.</p>

  <p>We specifically do not collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses.</li>
    <li>Geographic location data.</li>
    <li>Apple ID or subscription credentials.</li>
    <li>User-provided streaming URLs, credentials, or playlist contents.</li>
    <li>Viewing history or playback data related to the streams you access.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Data Processing and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>While the developer does not collect data, the App must process certain data to function. This processing is performed <strong>entirely locally on your Apple TV device</strong> and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties (except as noted in Section 4).</p>

  <h3>A. User Stream Data</h3>
  <p>The App allows you to input URLs and optional credentials (Usernames/Passwords) for accessing IPTV or media playlists (e.g., M3U files).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is processed locally to fetch and display the content you have requested.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> This data is stored only in the local storage of your Apple TV device. If you delete the App, this data is removed. It is never stored on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. App Diagnostics and Usage Data (Non-Personal)</h3>
  <p>We may rely on standard Apple (tvOS) systems for app usage data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To monitor app performance, identify bugs, and analyze general, aggregated usage trends (e.g., number of downloads, crash reports).</li>
    <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> This data is <strong>anonymized</strong> and aggregated by Apple and is not linked to your identity. If you have enabled sharing of diagnostic and usage data with app developers in your tvOS settings, this data may be shared with us in an aggregated form. You can disable this sharing through your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services Disclosure</h2>
  <p>KDTIVI integrates with no third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data brokers.</p>

  <h3>A. Apple App Store and Payment Processing</h3>
  <p>All payments for the App (if applicable) are processed directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not receive or store your payment information. Apple’s privacy policy governs the collection and use of your payment and purchase data.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Given that KDTIVI does not collect or store any user's personal data on our servers, the risk associated with a data breach on our end is effectively eliminated. The security of your User Stream Data, which remains on your device, is governed by the security features of your Apple TV operating system.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>KDTIVI is intended for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal data as described in this policy, we are compliant with children's privacy regulations.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date."</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
